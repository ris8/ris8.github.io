Virginica has the longest petals, with 5.552  
Setosa has the widest sepals, with 3.418

To get the averages, I repurposed the previous function, which categorized values, to instead sum the values of each plant's measurements. At the end, I just divide each of the measurements' sums by the number of times that plant occurs in the list, which is also counted during the initial loop. Originally, I considered having the keys be added dynamically, but I realized that would add fluff for the sake of fluff. I did not work with anybody.
