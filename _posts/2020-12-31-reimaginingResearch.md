[study](https://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993(15)00392-5/fulltext) 

1. How does the quality of an institution connect to the socioeconomic status of its geographic location? 

2. All hospitals which treat TBIs. We would need to know the quality of the insitution (like what is found in the study) and the socioeconomic status of its location. 

3. All hospitals named in the study, as that is a major part of the research already cut down. (and its already conveniently sized for a study) 

4. Stratified sampling using social and economic status markers. This gives insight into how socioeconomic status correlates with the quality of the insitutions, which is what we are looking for. 

5. The null and alternative hypotheses are no correlalation and some correlation, respectively. A correlation would probably favor better quality with better economic status, but, obviously, I don't actually know. 

6. This study would build off the data found in the linked study regarding institution quality, and require additional research into the socieconomic status of the institutions' locations. Since this is purely an observational study trying to find a correlation, I don't think there is a treatment. 

7. See above. 

8. Depending on our ability to research the insitutions (time and money), a reasonable sample size would be selected. Then, this sample would be chosen from our sample frame using the previously mentioned Stratified sampling. Finally, the data would be examined to determine if there is a correlation between the two sets of information (quality and status). 

9. To ensure consistency in the research done (and to make statistical research possible), quantitative observations are to be used as much as possible when collecting data; since this, again, not an experiment, there isn't as much of an opportunity for unintentional bias to seep in.
