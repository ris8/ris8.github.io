### Section 1
Most of my cs experience is either summer camps or HM classes. I did, however, take a machine learning/big data class over the summer, so I have experience with pandas and *basic* machine learning techniques. I'm currently taking pre-calc.
### Section 2
A big hobby of mine is flight simming, specifically [DCS](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/). It originally came out in 2008, so it has a distinctly 2000s era video game name, but it's been updated many, *many* times since then. It definitely doesn't have 2000s era graphics: ![hornet pic](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/597/dcs-world-f-a-18c-hornet-20-flight-simulator.jpg)
### Section 3
I'm really looking forwards to actually working with data, and learning how to actually manipulate it at a lower level. While I've used libraries like pandas to manipulate datasets, I don't really know much about the different types of datasets or how to efficiently access them.
